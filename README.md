# HumdrumUtilities
A collection of utilities and functions to make Humdrum processing easier.

(Inpired by Nate Landau's [BASH SHELL SCRIPTING UTILITIES](https://natelandau.com/bash-scripting-utilities/))

## How to use these utilities
I have a single file called `humdrumutils.sh` in which I place all my bash scripting functions. I keep this in file in `~/humdrum-tools/humdrum-utils/`. Sourcing these utilities is as simple as writing a single line near the top any bash script.

```
#!/bin/bash

source ~/humdrum-tools/humdrum-utils/humdrumutils.sh

# (some script here)
```
